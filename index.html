       <!--  Epistemological Design and Design Epistemology <br> -->

        Epistemology is the study of knowledge - how we come to understand what we understand. Plato draws “The Definition of Knowledge” in the 5th century: Truth here means absolute truth, in combination with individual Belief, we have Knowledge. Fast forward to 2019, some 1500 years later, one can find similarity in a political cartoon by Avi Steinberg, initially published in the New York Times and subsequently popularized on Instagram. “The Real World” as it is, filtered through “My [perspective of the] World”, we have "The Actual World” as we would experience and come to understand it. <br>

        What is interesting here is not to look at the resemblance but rather, if we shrink down Plato’s “The Definition of Knowledge”, where is it positioned within Steinberg’s cartoon today. Plato being Plato, the founder of the first institution of higher learning in the Western World, his work could easily be regarded as “The Real World”, the “Truth”. Except it is not. It is not to say Plato isn’t correct, but his diagram should be viewed as “Belief”, his belief. It is only if one thinks through and draws up their own interpretation based on his view, that it becomes one’s own ‘World’, one’s ‘Belief’. <br>

        Through this, we can establish that there are two kind of knowledges. 1) Expert knowledge, the kind of institutional knowledge that is generated and endorsed by formal disciplines, the sciences, academics and related professions. And there is also 2) the knowledge of the personal, the experiential. The latter is also what Indian-American anthropologist Arjun Appadurai proposes as The Right to Research. “All human beings are, in [a] sense, researchers, since all human beings make decisions that require them to make systematic forays beyond their current knowledge horizons.” By shifting research from a professional activity to a right, Appadurai argues that individual exploration and discovery, whether it has relevance to others, is no less, if not more important than knowledge that is directly taught and imposed directly upon said individual. As our planet becomes yet more global and interconnected, not being informed of the structures and systems in place that profoundly influence our lives means we are not exercising full citizenship. The democratizing of personal inquiries also mirrors Joseph Beuys’ belief that everyone is an artist, and that “society as a whole is to be regarded as one great work of art, to which each person can contribute creatively”. <br>

        So what is the epistemology of design? How design today come to make sense of the world and in turn engage others to make sense of the world? American–Israeli designer Neri Oxman’s Krebs Cycle of Creativity gives a quick answer: a map for four domains of creative exploration—Science, Engineering, Design and Art. According to Oxman, Design operates in-between Behaviour and Utility, and deals with production and culture. While it is true that design encompasses almost every part of our lives, thanks to industrial revolution and the capitalist market, there have also been a movement for design to shift away from being a technical discipline to more of a cultural one. <br>

        At the opening of “GEO—DESIGN: Junk. All That Is Solid Melts into Trash” at the Van Abbe Museum in Eindhoven, curator Martina Muzi introduces the participating designers by saying, “they have researched the topics for months, and they have become experts and that we can believe what we see [in the exhibition]”. This is a curious notion. The work in the exhibition feels conclusive and provides a sense of authority, and that they should be “believed”. But if we unpack the statement further, it seems to suggest that research is something that happen before design, and that design is the end point of research. Furthermore, what research and these designers are experts of what? The mode of engagement is also in question. When one is encountered with an art exhibition, it is clear that the works are the artists’ interpretation of a particular matter. As the audiences, we have the choice to agree or disagree with them. With design, it is presented as if they were the definitive answers to all things. Here, design is still viewed as a formal discipline - one for the production, production (or at worst translator) of “expert knowledge”. <br>

        We are not artists, we are not investigative journalists, we are not scientists. We do not need pretend to work with “expert knowledge" to legitimate ourselves. It is almost as if we have forgotten about utility, forgotten how to engage people. Modernest architects spend years studying the human behaviours to make sure a chair is conformable for its user. Here we are merely relying on the affordance of the gallery space - abstracting the “general public” as a standard group of audience that we are superior to and presenting them with our “research”. <br>

        Pip Mothersill pointed out “there is no single design, only design rationale.” What’s known to be design is one suitable narrative to justify the decisions made during the process of being, and the non-section of the alternatives. This mirrors Gaston Bachelard ideas of epistemological obstacle - “the multiple obstacles that had to be negated or transcended dialectically—and thus absorbed—in the process of arriving at more rational levels of knowledge.” Perhaps then we first have to break down what we understood as design by looking into the cracks for the neglected “left overs” - the forgotten prototype in the studio, the scape on the cutting room floor, the dusted sketch book. It is only through exploring the messy openers that we can truly establish design as an epistemological discipline, shifting it from the static facts of make aware and represent to performative acts of experiments and working through. <br>

        Design in the World and Design about the World <br>

        When criticizing ‘decoloniality’ being a empty signifier in design, scholar Ahmed Ansari bring the design’s mode of operation into question, “Trying to “solve” coloniality by producing a range of cultural artifacts without trying to change or at the very least, reimagine, the systems within which those artifacts are imagined, produced, distributed, and consumed, is like treating a severely ill person by merely alleviating their symptoms.” What Ansari refers to here are the fundamentals of how design functions - imagined, produced, distributed and consumed. It is vital that as designers, we acknowledge and examine them carefully - how other systems of forces have come to influence the way we operate and how what we do is in turn reenforce these systems. <br>

        Chinese-Canadian conceptual artist Tobias Wong’s “Coke Spoon 2” exemplify this best - a gold cast of McDonalds’s disposable spoon: In the 1970s, the hight of consumer culture in America, McDonalds introduced its plastic stirrer spoon in part to aid their customers in adding sugar and cream, and also to help promote the company, thanks to the emblazoned logo at the tip of said design. What was not expected is the spoon found its alternative popularity among cocaine users. The added functionality was noticed by the company trough drug related court cases, and subsequently, the spoon design was pulled from the company’s offering. Wong’s recreation in 2005 is a commentary on ”the nature of design, […] the gap between design for mass consumption and design for luxury connoisseurship.” The gold spoon being an appropriation of an appropriation, what is in question here is also who is allowed to create culture as two years later, Wong was sued by McDonalds for trademark infringement. <br>

        Thought this line of thinking, we can think of our role as a designer is merely one faction of a larger trajectory and that we are not separable to the world we live. What can we do then? A comparison between two drone projects might offer a preposition: 1) Drone Survival Guide by Dutch designer Ruben Pater is a foldable poster depicting the silhouettes of the 27 best known military drones employed around the world. Printed on metallic coated paper, as a counter measure to reflect the sun to the camera on board, the poster is is open sourced and available to be downloaded by anything who has access to the internet. 2) Drone Shadows by British artist and author James Bridle are public installation of one to one scale outlines of military drones drawn on varies city street around the world. <br>

        While both projects seek to address issues around airspace, privacy and surveillance and seem identical, they are not. The practitioners’ positions and engagements are key. Open source is democratic in theory, but in practice, only people who were interested in drones or designers (or at the very least, people who were searching for them) will find the field guide. While the field guide is humorous it is conformable. Where on the other hand, Bridle’s drawing are encountered by thousands of citizens at their least expected place and time - interruptively bringing these seemly out of grasp issues into and personal relational experience. It is not a question of attendance and participation, context matter. A workshop designed to look at the surveillance issue the attended by a group of gallerists and cultural practitioners who are already familiar of the issue would have less impact than if it were attended by a group who are not - What British designer and educator Bahbak Hashemi-Nezhad called “defamiliariztion”. <br>

        Secondly, there is a certain authority that comes with design. It is difficult to find the Drone Survival Guide without knowing that it is Ruben Pater’s project, who is known for his research in the politic of design. The bias and criticality that comes with his position is imposed to the reader trough the guild. A passerby who come across Bridle’s drawing on the street would not even know it was done by a famous artist. The social hierarchy of the creator is muted and the “audience” is given the agency to explore their own position within the issue. In another sense, Bridle didn’t present the work as the expert. <br>

        The differences are subtile but they are critical. One position the design as a outsider observing the world where the other acknowledge the design is part of world. <br>

        Everyday Design and Designed Everyday <br>

        To being unpacking what design has designed - let’s take a look at the notion of ‘everyday’ through its application in design, as a reflection on the practice and profession itself. <br>

        The everyday has become synonymous with design: Don Norman’s book “The Design of Everyday Things” that has become the bible for many bachelor design studies over the last decades, and more recently in 2017, Adam Greenfield’s book “Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life” - again, demonstrates the shift from designing design to design designs; From the market, we have the Tiffany and Co. hand crafted sterling silver tin can in their “Everyday Objects Collection” that “renders the ordinary extraordinary”; Nokia releases its “The Amazing Everyday” campaign for the LUMIA 800 smartphone, “Who says the everyday has to be so everyday?”, they said - Coincidentally that also marks the first smartphone from the company joining its competitor in using one of the major operational systems instead of using their own, joining the normality if you will - note the irony; In Architecture we have Ward Robert’s photo collection “The Beauty of Everyday Life” documenting public courts in varies cities around the world - with the absence of people, curiously. <br>

        What’s clear then is that the ‘everyday’ in design, despite being seemingly universal, and following a particular logic - the ordinary, the mundane, the utilitarian, the normal - is never clearly defined. Design is a projective discipline (Anthropocene Nights, Benedict Singleton, 2012), that not only gives form to the present, it also gives space for further imagination of what is possible. The ‘everyday’ becomes a container term that projects the belief system and world view it represents. Consciously or not, it reinforces certain social, cultural, technical or economic values. What is worth noting here is the representation of everyday perpetuated by design: It cements the “operational logic whose models may go as far back as the age-old ruses of fishes and insects that disguise or transform themselves in order to survive, and which has in any case been concealed by the form of rationality currently dominant in Western culture.” (The Practice of Everyday Life, Michel de Certeau, 1980) <br>

        Through this line of thinking, we can establish the everyday in design as a singular narrative, what English Sociologist John Law has called the “one-world world: a world that has granted itself the right to assimilate all other worlds and, by presenting itself as exclusive, cancels possibilities for what lies beyond its limits.” Design designed the everyday. The question remains, whose everyday are we referring to? <br>

        Designing Poetry and Poetic Design

        ‘Poetic’ is an adjective that is often being used to describe design, but what does ‘poetic design’ actually mean and how are the two mediums linked together? A quick scroll through the internet finds: design projects that deal directly with poetry, like the poetry-spouting lion installation in London and Google’s Poetric - an public intervention that stitch passer-by’s conversation into poems, Poetic Design is a graphic design studio focusing on branding (well their website is down), a fictional conference by Karim Rashid and an undergraduate design course at University of Technology Sydney, with the emphasis on the everyday. Search poetic as keyword on design blogs and the list goes on: “Minimal metallic stationery by Poetic Lab”, “Demeter Fogarasi’s Poetic Furniture chair appears to have been blown into shape”, “[The passport design] is very poetic and elegant” to name just a few.

        It does not take long to notice that the usage of poetic in relation to design often has to do with their aesthetic - either minimalistic in appearance and/or simplicity of forms, often time traditional craft-based, and it is almost always attached to a general sense of positivity and upliftedness. The ambiguity of poetry is robbed and compressed into the confined, already established understanding of design. It seems that this superficial way of referring to formal quality is limiting the potential for a deeper and more nuanced relationship.

        It has not always been like this. Delving into the origin of poetry and design, there exists a curious etymological link. The word poetry is derived from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, which means “to make”. In this context, to make does not necessarily refer directly to the physical act of making but rather it represents the transformational notion of creation. German philosopher Martin Heidegger refers to poiesis as a “forth-bringing”; to bring something into existence that was not there before, to move away from one’s standing and become another. “The blooming of the blossom, the coming-out of a butterfly from a cocoon, the plummeting of a waterfall when the snow begins to melt”. It is a process in which the work reconciles thought with matter and time, a person’s understanding of the world. Through this, we can establish that poetry has a purpose to unpacking, revealing and connecting with others and at large, the world, and that this process is ongoing.

        Design, of course also means to make, to designate, to plot out. But from its Greek roots, it also means to conceptualize, to approximate - a vague or as-of-yet undefined process of genesis. From an archaeological perspective, to design is what sets us apart as a species. Take the Acheulean hand axe, for example, it is a tool, but it functions equally significant as an ornament - contributing to the indeterminacy and potentiality of what is possible. It signifies itself as a axe and opens up other new forms of tools. It is a result of imagination and simultaneously a trigger for it. Archaeologists Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley describe the action of designing as “to go beyond what is needed, to make something different or differently”. Here the link to design’s Greek roots becomes more visible. An idea that has been conceived, but not put in to action - whether intentionally or not. Rather than a defined act, or action, design becomes a space for the indeterminate, an attempt to give form to elusive thoughts rather than a definitive answer.

        Within this line of thinking, we can see both design and poetry were never merely about making new things, they are processes of unsettling or continuing the world. They are both mediums of projection, and engage in some level of manipulation of reality. Perhaps then, it is a sense of openness that is missing from the way we think about poetic design (and design in general) today. The question of engagement seem to be at play - the quality of how the two mediums function beyond the hands of their creator. Poetry is democratic - what New Critical calls “intentional fallacy” - a poem does not belong to its author, rather, “it is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.” The ownership of the poem lies in the readers’ own interpretation - the way it is consumed - to put it in designerly term. When a poem is being consumed, a different poem than the one of the author is being articulated in the readers’s mind. Chinese Artist Ai Weiwei once expressed, “to experience poetry is to see over and above reality. It is to discover that which is beyond the physical, to experience another life and another level of feeling.” Design occupies every aspect of our lived experience; but is design then too real to re/create poetry? Rather than seeing design as singular isolated things or acts, can possible though to see design as fragments, that they are ambiguous and are part of a larger ongoing narrative, that they are continuously evolving, in and out of designers’ hands?

        Design Designs and Designing Design <br>

        Order matters. Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to neglect the importance of a certain story, you simply employ the linguistic trick of beginning the story with “secondly”. In September 2018, the student body of Design Academy Eindhoven, one of the leading voices in contemporary design, was greeted by their creative director Joseph Grima’s speech on the responsibility of designing design - it is their role to be the avant-garde of design, to find where design is needed next, in the interconnected network culture we live in. By placing design second, design itself is rendered as a means to an end and the activity of designing something new by designer is once again (Beyond the New, Schouwenberg and Jongerius, 2018 - time for beyond the new beyond the new?), on the centre stage. The responsibility here seems to be concerning the designer’s own position to design, rather than what our designs have done, or what our designs will do. Nothing has changed. <br>

        Words also matter. Salishan language of the indigenous people in the Pacific Northwest has the words in/an for the English determiner my/mine. But it is not a straight translation. In/an are not to be used before anything from the natural world, that is in its true essence, everything we do and act upon. There is no “my land” or “my chair” or even “my uncle”. To the Salish people, In/an are relational terms, rather than indicating fixed ownership and possession. It is a bond, a connection. Every time in/an are used, the relationship between the subject and the object is being reconsidered and expressed. It is never static. Today, while many reconciliation effects are being made by governments around the world to return land to indigenous people, it is important to remember that land was never owned before the settler’s arrival. The idea of ownership was imposed to the indigenous people in exchange for their survival. Giving land back is merely a colonial solution to a colonial problem. - hardly decolonizing. Nothing has changed. <br>

        American literary critic John Freemen urges us to retain “vigilance about how language is used” (Dictionary of Undoing, John Freenmen, 2019). Language shape values, reinforce the status quo and obstruct the possibility of change. What is at stake when language is used, is not merely an issue of representation, framing, referring or categorizing: but one of worldly understanding and the systems by which we come to be. Language shapes our understanding of reality and in turn, reality itself. Design is no exception. <br>

        In the West, we seem obsessed with what we can do with design and we rarely discuss what design does to us, how it limits us. Here we can consider the role of design as a double ontology: that what we design also designs us - ‘design designs’ as design theorist Anne-Marie Wills writes. Design itself takes on its own design role beyond the designer’s hand. To borrow the Salishan value system again, perhaps we could imagine a world where “my design” does not exist? There is no “my object” or “my material”, only design as its own entity. How would we come to understand the profession of design today without ownership or authorship, or would the profession even exist? Could we reclaim what makes designs design and subvert design for more democratic purposes? Or to further the disposition by borrowing Donna Haraway’s quote from Staying with The Trouble: “it matters what knots knot knots, what thoughts think thoughts, what descriptions describe descriptions, what ties tie ties.” In this context, it matters what designs design designs. <br>

        Questioning Design and the Question of Design <br>

        Design needs to reclaim its own languages, and stop pretending to speak other people’s languages.
        - Sir Christopher John Frayling, British educationalist and writer (RTD Provocation, 2015) <br>

        Broadly speaking, we could break up most design texts into four categories, with some slippage in-between. 1. Text for design; in terms of writing that accompanies design for market purposes - to sell, to elevate, in the context of pitch meetings, to advisements and increasingly in media. These texts are narrative and almost always supportive in tone. Then we are borrowing Frayling’s (with reference to Herbert Read) categorization of the three kinds of research that come out from design - research into design, research through design and research as design. By replacing the word research with text, we have 2. Text into design; in terms of the historializing and theorizing of design, a study of design itself. These often follow formal academic structures and logics that are appropriated from the fields of science and social studies. 3. Text through design; similar to research through design, where knowledge is generated through the action of designing, the text functions to contextualize for a wider audience - translating the said generated designerly knowledge into languages - think the role of a design curator. The first three are concerned with theorizing practice: treating text as a discipline that sits next to design as a form of communicational tool. Often, text enters at the end of the design process as textual analysis, conclusion, or at worst post-rationalization. What we are interested here is 4. Text as design; the text becomes the medium to design, to think with. What happen if we bring text into the studio and contaminate it with the messy end of design approaches and processes? Could we see design text as an open platform for modest exploration and self reflexivity? <br>

        In 1967, French literary critic Roland Barthes argues in his essay “The Death of the Author” for a repositioning in subject-object relation between the author and the text. In his view, an "author" only exists as the product of a text, and not the other way around. Same could be explored for design, for another time perhaps, does a “designer” only exist as the product of the design? Barthes goes on to state, “The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture… the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original. His only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them.” <br>

        Two years later, another French literary critic Michel Foucault published “What is an Author?”, which follows Barthes essay and breaks down authorship - there is no longer a sole author, but a triumvirate of “authors”, pushing and pulling between the author, the text and the reader. The text and the reader are given equal agency to generate ideas of their own no less important than the author. We are all “authors”. Evidently, Foucault was a reader of Barthes’ text and he drew up his own interjection, and committed it back to paper. In this sense, Text is never stable, but continuously in flux. <br>

        With that mind, this text is written in fragments, a collection of small compositions or to the function of poems. This text is unfinished. This text does not seek to provide one conclusive statement on one specific subject, rather, it seeks to draw a line across theories, projects and observations within and around design, stitching together paradoxical narratives and perspectives that may otherwise never cross paths. In times when designers are stepping into varies societal issues with the badge of “doing good” - challenging dysfunctional governance, resolving migration crisis, tackling global warming, decolonizing education, reviving craft - the culture of answers is no longer viable. Through subverting the mode of operation, the objective here is to reclaim the formal understanding of design - i.e. material, aesthetic and functionality - to become a relational and epistemic one. <br>
