- Sir Christopher John Frayling, British educationalist and writer (RTD Provocation, 2015) <br>

Broadly speaking, we could break up most design texts into four categories, with some slippage in-between. 1. Text for design; in terms of writing that accompanies design for market purposes - to sell, to elevate, in the context of pitch meetings, to advisements and increasingly in media. These texts are narrative and almost always supportive in tone. Then we are borrowing Frayling’s (with reference to Herbert Read) categorization of the three kinds of research that come out from design - research into design, research through design and research as design. By replacing the word research with text, we have 2. Text into design; in terms of the historializing and theorizing of design, a study of design itself. These often follow formal academic structures and logics that are appropriated from the fields of science and social studies. 3. Text through design; similar to research through design, where knowledge is generated through the action of designing, the text functions to contextualize for a wider audience - translating the said generated designerly knowledge into languages - think the role of a design curator. The first three are concerned with theorizing practice: treating text as a discipline that sits next to design as a form of communicational tool. Often, text enters at the end of the design process as textual analysis, conclusion, or at worst post-rationalization. What we are interested here is 4. Text as design; the text becomes the medium to design, to think with. What happen if we bring text into the studio and contaminate it with the messy end of design approaches and processes? Could we see design text as an open platform for modest exploration and self reflexivity? <br>

In 1967, French literary critic Roland Barthes argues in his essay “The Death of the Author” for a repositioning in subject-object relation between the author and the text. In his view, an "author" only exists as the product of a text, and not the other way around. Same could be explored for design, for another time perhaps, does a “designer” only exist as the product of the design? Barthes goes on to state, “The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture… the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original. His only power is to mix writings, to counter the ones with the others, in such a way as never to rest on any one of them.” <br>

Two years later, another French literary critic Michel Foucault published “What is an Author?”, which follows Barthes essay and breaks down authorship - there is no longer a sole author, but a triumvirate of “authors”, pushing and pulling between the author, the text and the reader. The text and the reader are given equal agency to generate ideas of their own no less important than the author. We are all “authors”. Evidently, Foucault was a reader of Barthes’ text and he drew up his own interjection, and committed it back to paper. In this sense, Text is never stable, but continuously in flux. <br>

With that mind, this text is written in fragments, a collection of small compositions or to the function of poems. This text is unfinished. This text does not seek to provide one conclusive statement on one specific subject, rather, it seeks to draw a line across theories, projects and observations within and around design, stitching together paradoxical narratives and perspectives that may otherwise never cross paths. In times when designers are stepping into varies societal issues with the badge of “doing good” - challenging dysfunctional governance, resolving migration crisis, tackling global warming, decolonizing education, reviving craft - the culture of answers is no longer viable. Through subverting the mode of operation, the objective here is to reclaim the formal understanding of design - i.e. material, aesthetic and functionality - to become a relational and epistemic one. <br>
